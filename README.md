# Financial-Assistance-Website
**First Edit** (03/15/2022) - This is a website for a financial assistance company called EdgeLedger (a madeup name). In this website I have incorporated what I learned about CSS in the last few weeks, like 
CSS Flexbox, CSS variables (or custom properties) and responsive media queries. I have used flexbox to align items instead of floats (as in my last project), and CSS variables to store various colors that have been used
throughout the project. I have also added responsive media queries and the website looks good on devices that are found on Chrome tools. My media query is for devices with screen 
width less than 768px (basically tablets and smartphones).  

In order to enhance code reusablity, I created some classes that are used repeatedly and act like a framework. 

The project has 3 HTML pages- 
a. index.html - It is the home page, which the user first sees. It has all the sections of the website like about, contact info etc.  
b. blog_homepage.html - Here we have the markup for the blog homepage, which is one of my inner page. The blog section on the home page leads us to this page. 
c. post.html - Here we have the markup for a blog written by company's president. The post section on the blog homepage leads us to this page. 

The project has 3 CSS files-
a. home_style.css - It contains all the styling of the home page. 
b. blog_style.css - It has all the styling for the blog homepage. 
c. post_style.css - It has all the styling for the blog itself.

# Financial-Assistance-Website
**First Edit** This is a website for a financial website called EdgeLedger (a madeup name). In this website I have incorporated what I learned about CSS in the last few weeks, like 
CSS Flexbox, CSS variables (or custom properties) and responsive media queries. I have used flexbox to align items instead of floats, and CSS variables to store various colors I 
have used in the project. I have also added responsive media queries and the project works well on devices that are found on Chrome tools. My media query is for devices with screen 
width less than 768px (basically tablets and smartphones).
